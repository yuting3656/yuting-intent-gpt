- pos (part-of-speech)
   
   - In NLP, POS stands for "part of speech". It refers to the grammatical category of a word, such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, and interjection. POS tagging is the process of assigning a POS tag to each word in a text corpus based on its grammatical function in a sentence. This information is useful for many natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling, named entity recognition, and machine translation. 

- ner (named entity recognition)

   - In natural language processing (NLP), NER stands for Named Entity Recognition. It is a subtask of information extraction that involves identifying named entities (e.g. persons, organizations, locations, etc.) from unstructured text and categorizing them into predefined classes. NER is used in a variety of applications such as search engines, chatbots, and recommendation systems.
